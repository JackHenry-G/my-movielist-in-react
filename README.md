# Learning REACT project

This project was created purely as a way for me to learn REACT and get hands on development with the framework. To do this, I am changing my existing project from a standard HTML/CSS/JS to a REACT way of doing things.

WORK IN PROGRESS.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
